<h3> I'm an aspiring web developer</h3>
<p>
  I'm brand new to the coding world and am excited to learn new things! I have aspirations to become a web developer in the near-ish future and I'm currently taking a course to learn the ropes.
  I would appreciate any feedback or tips you may have for this newbie.

<h3>Me as a developer:</h3>

  <li>Before I decided to learn web development, I aspired to be a UI/UX designer, so I have some design background </li>
  <li>I want to become a Frontend Developer</li>
</ul>
